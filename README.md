# ROS Wheel Speeds
ROS package for reading rotary encoders and converting to wheel speeds for a Raspberry Pi based differential drive robot.

Depends on [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) to build

Publishes a message containing individual wheel speeds as well as Unicycle Model linear and angular velocities

Written to work with ROS Kinetic, no idea if it works with other versions
